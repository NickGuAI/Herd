# Herd is the meta-harness for agent interaction.

Cursor is obsolete. Pair-programming with one chatbot is a dead end; the next interface is Herd: a meta-harness above Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and the machines where they run.

Herd owns mission state, worker orchestration, memory, approvals, and the command-room surface. Connectivity and execution stay delegated to harnesses and infrastructure you already trust: provider CLIs, SSH, Tailscale, hosted runtimes, and your own reverse proxy. The mission graph and execution rules stay stable even when the underlying harness or transport changes.

**Manage agent work, not terminal tabs.**

| Step | Operator action | Herd outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **01** | Install the control plane on a trusted machine. | Hermetic Node/pnpm toolchain, local env, server boot, and bootstrap sign-in. |
| **02** | Connect provider auth and machines. | Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, local hosts, SSH boxes, and Tailscale machines become explicit runtime targets. |
| **03** | Run commanders and workers from Command Room. | Work is queued, delegated, reviewed, remembered, and recoverable. |

## What Herd Is

Herd is an open-source meta-harness for personal agent fleets.

It looks like an operating room for agent work. Under the hood: commanders, workers, persistent memory, agent-harness readiness, machine routing, action policies, approvals, public docs, and an install path that keeps the runtime on infrastructure you own.

```text
operator intent -> Herd meta-harness -> agent harnesses -> your machines -> durable mission state
```

## Herd Is Right For You If

- You coordinate more than one AI agent harness and need a persistent command surface above them.
- You run the web control plane on a Linux host and connect only machines you administer.
- You want agents to keep mission memory across provider sessions, browser tabs, and worker restarts.
- You need sensitive actions to be reviewable instead of blindly executed.
- You want public, agent-readable docs that describe setup, operations, references, and recovery.

## Quickstart

The installer is hermetic for the Node toolchain. It needs `git`, `curl`, `tar`, and outbound HTTPS; it installs Node `22.16.0` and pnpm `10.23.0` in a local toolchain directory without replacing or relying on your system Node. Herd uses Node's built-in SQLite driver for the local runtime-session database, so older Node 22 builds that require `--experimental-sqlite` are not supported.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://herd.gehirn.ai/install.sh | bash
```

The installer clones Herd, prepares the local app environment file, installs the hermetic toolchain and dependencies, builds the app, boots the shell once, seeds a one-time bootstrap API key, and prints the local sign-in URL.

Continue with the [full quickstart](./docs/getting-started/quickstart.md) to complete first-run onboarding, provider auth, machine readiness, and the first useful commander run.

## Problems Herd Solves

| Without Herd | With Herd |
| --- | --- |
| One chatbot owns the conversation, state, and bottleneck. | Commanders assign parallel workers while Command Room keeps the mission coherent. |
| Agent sessions vanish when a tab, machine, or provider session dies. | Mission state, memory, approvals, and history persist outside any single transport. |
| Remote machines and local laptops require bespoke scripts and manual tracking. | Machines are registered, checked for readiness, and used as explicit worker execution targets. |
| External actions either run blindly or require constant babysitting. | Action policies make approval, auto-run, and block behavior inspectable and adjustable. |

## Bundled Commander Workforce

Fresh Herd installs include a backend-owned commander marketplace and a starter workforce:

- **Asina**: engineering manager for issue triage, code investigation, review, orchestration, and release follow-through.
- **Einstein**: research intelligence analyst for web research, knowledge search, domain distillation, and reports.
- **Alfred**: general assistant for meeting prep, scheduling support, inbox/doc triage, and daily follow-through.

Open the Marketplace page or complete first-run onboarding to install the starter workforce. Packages are inspectable in the bundled commander package directory; each package contains `COMMANDER.md`, `skills.manifest.json`, `memory-seed.md`, `onboarding.md`, and examples. The required starter skill dependencies ship in `agent-skills/herd-starter/` so a fresh public checkout has the workflows the bundled commanders advertise.

## Deploy Shapes

| Shape | Use it when | Docs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Linux web host** | You want the supported self-hosted control plane behind your own reverse proxy or load balancer. | [Hardening](./docs/operate/hardening.md) |
| **iOS client** | You want a supported mobile client connected to your Herd instance. | [Platform support](./docs/reference/platforms.md) |
| **macOS / Windows** | Unsupported for v1 self-hosted control-plane deployment. | [Platform support](./docs/reference/platforms.md) |
